# weekendCarouselChallenge

This is a current work in progress.  The assignment is to create a carousel of items that are contained in a json file.  An ajax call is made
to the server for the inidividual objects in the json file and each item is displayed upon clicking a forward(next) or back button.

The initial commit includes minor bootstrap styling, the server call from an ajax method and hte file setup of the MEAN stack.
