CarouselChallenge

UPDATED OCTOBER 3rd 2015

In this assignment we created a jquery carousel using data from a JSON file.  An AJAX call to the server, where JSON data is stored,
is made from the client-side app.js file and then that data is returned.  Upon success, a function is used to take in the data objects.  Jquery
methods are used to then change the DOM.

Technologies Used:

HTML5
CSS
Bootstrap
Jquery
Data Model-JSON Data
Server NodeJS

Lessons Learned:

Parsing JSON Data from an Ajax call
Using addClass and removeClass to manipulate the view with CSS styles
Additional GitHub practice
